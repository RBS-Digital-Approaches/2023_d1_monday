If you spend more time doing this kind of work, a lot of what we'll do in this notebook will come to seem completely routine.\n","\n","If you *have* done a fair amount of coding before, you'll probably have immediately started thinking through how you'd go about exploring the question (or could start coming up with a plan in a minute or two).

We'll see other variations this week.\n","\n","Then—still in line 1—we're creating a new variable (`marc_file`) to represent the file we've just opened. This part can be a little confusing because it's not necessarily obvious that the word `as` would mean something like \"Create a new variable and assign a value to it,\" but that's what's implicit in that formula. (Opening files is something you have to do a lot, so having a very terse, economical syntax for doing it is a real convenience.)\n","\n","Line two creates *another* variable (`marc_reader`).

So far, we've only dealt with lists. Let's explore a somewhat more involved data type for holding all the information we're getting about living vs. dead authors.\n","\n","A dictionary stores information in key/value pairs. That is, for each value there's a corresponding label. Dictionaries can hold any kind of data, including not just strings or integers, but also lists or other dictionaries (as well as another data type—the tuple—that we may run into later). So dictionaries can end up being complex, nested data structures, if need be.\n","\n","For our purposes, let's keep track of living vs. dead authors for each year.

(For now, suffice it to say that tuples are [kind of like lists, but different](https://diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html#tuples).)\n","\n","So to get the values for a given year, we would give the dictionary name followed by the key in square brackets (e.g. `author_count[1730]`). Because the value for each year is *another* dictionary, we would get those values by providing the key for the nested dictionary (e.g., `author_count[1730]['total_works']`—note that, while `1730` is an integer, `'total_works'` is a string, so `'total_works'` needs to be in quotation marks, while `1730` doesn't).\n","\n","For each record we encounter, the first thing we'll get is the publication year.
